      July 11th, 2149. Personal log number 2887. United Earth''s Army Research Institute
      have come recently up with a great innovation to our weapons. According to them,
      we will be able to finally stop relying on ammunition. Not sure what the new
      system is based on, but it has something to do with friction. As far as I understood,
      by shooting weapon heats up and shoots... lasers? I think that''s the most accurate,
      human-understandable word for ''beams of thermal energy''.'

    dialogueSentences: Anyway, it sounds like the weapon will be overheating, so our
      soldiers can't sadly fire infinitely. On the other hand, those lasers are more
      than capable of penetrating most of armor types known to mankind. Pretty cool.
      It's still experimental, but I have heard rumors special forces are going to
      use it sooner than the rest of the Army. Those guys are crazy, but I don't think
      anyone understands them. Atkinson out.
