    dialogueSentences: "Engineer Hack: Nothing, general. By reducing the pilot's cockpit
      space by 7% and hence reducing the total mass of the spacecraft by 2%, we were

      in speed. Our pilots will not have much space at all, but we do as you ordered,
      Sir\n\t\nGeneral Watson: Very well. Keep me up to date."
