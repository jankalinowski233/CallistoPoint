    dialogueSentences: Nothing, general. By reducing the pilot's cockpit space by
      7% and hence reducing the total mass of the spacecraft by 2%, we were able to
      load additional two long-range rockets without significant decrease in speed.
      Our pilots will not have much space at all, but we do as you ordered, Sir.
